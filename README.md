# Cryptographic

The file 1.1_symmetric_ecryption.py implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms. The encrypt_Function function takes a message and a shift key, then returns the encrypted text, while the decrypt_Function function takes a ciphertext and a shift key to return the decrypted text. The main function interacts with the user to input a shift key and a message, and then prints the encrypted and decrypted versions of the message.

The file 1.2_symmetric_decryption.py  includes a decrypt_Function that decrypts a secret message using the Caesar Cipher decryption algorithm and a hacking_Function to retrieve the original message by trying all possible keys for the given ciphertext.
